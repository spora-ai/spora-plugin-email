# Email Plugin for Spora

**SMTP send + IMAP read for Spora agents.** Point it at any SMTP/IMAP host
(Gmail, Outlook, Fastmail, iCloud, or a self-hosted Postfix+Dovecot) and give
agents a single `email` tool with 11 operations covering inbox read, folder
management, drafts, sending, and message state.

Under the hood: **SMTP** via [Symfony Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html)
([RFC 5321](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321)) and **IMAP** via
[webklex/php-imap](https://www.php-imap.com/) ([RFC 3501](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501)).

## Installation

```bash
php bin/spora plugin:install spora-ai/spora-plugin-email
```

For local development against a sibling checkout, pass `--path=/abs/path/to/checkout`.

After install, the tool is registered as `email` in Spora's `communication` category. Operations are dispatched via a single `action` parameter (see [Per-tool operations](#per-tool-operations)).

## Configuration

Settings → Tools → Email. The same `email_username` and
`email_password` are used for both IMAP and SMTP authentication.

| Setting | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `imap_host` | yes (for read operations) | — | e.g. `imap.gmail.com` |
| `imap_port` | no | `993` | IMAPS port; use `143` with `tls` (STARTTLS) |
| `imap_encryption` | no | `ssl` | `ssl` (implicit TLS), `tls` (STARTTLS), or `notls` (not recommended) |
| `imap_timeout` | no | `60` | Seconds before an IMAP connection fails |
| `email_username` | yes | — | Full email address, used for IMAP **and** SMTP |
| `email_password` | yes | — | Account password or app password |
| `smtp_host` | yes (for send operations) | — | e.g. `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `smtp_port` | no | `587` | Submission port; use `465` with `ssl` |
| `smtp_encryption` | no | `tls` | `ssl`, `tls`, or `notls` |
| `smtp_from` | yes (for send/draft) | — | The `From:` address the agent sends as |
| `smtp_allowed_recipients` | no | _(empty = allow any)_ | Comma-separated exact addresses the agent may send to, or `*` for any. **Empty = unrestricted; set an explicit list for production.** |
| `smtp_timeout` | no | `30` | Seconds before an SMTP connection fails |

`email_password` is encrypted at rest by Spora's `ToolConfigService`,
masked in the UI, and never logged. SMTP recipient filtering is enforced by
`EmailSettingsResolver::validateSmtpSettings` before any message is queued
to the Symfony Mailer transport.

## Per-tool operations

The `email` tool exposes 11 `action` values. The three read-side operations
(`read_inbox`, `list_folders`, `read_folder`) are enabled by default; the
remaining eight are gated behind a per-tool "require approval" flag and are
disabled by default except `create_draft`, which defaults to off with no
approval required.

| Operation | Approval | Purpose | Parameters (types) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read_inbox` | no | Recent messages from `INBOX` | `limit` int (default 5, max 20), `unread_only` bool, `mark_as_read` bool (irreversible) |
| `list_folders` | no | All mailbox folders | _(none)_ |
| `read_folder` | no | Recent messages from a named folder | `folder` string (required), `limit` int |
| `create_draft` | no | Save a draft to `Drafts` via IMAP `APPEND` | `to` string, `subject` string, `body` string (all required) |
| `send_email` | yes | SMTP send via Symfony Mailer | `to` string, `subject` string, `body` string (all required; `to` checked against `smtp_allowed_recipients`) |
| `create_folder` | yes | IMAP `CREATE` | `new_folder` string (required) |
| `rename_folder` | yes | IMAP `RENAME` | `folder` string (old name), `new_folder` string (required) |
| `delete_folder` | yes | IMAP `DELETE` (blocks system folders) | `folder` string (required) |
| `move_email` | yes | IMAP `COPY` + `EXPUNGE` | `uid` int, `folder` string (source), `new_folder` string (destination) |
| `delete_email` | yes | IMAP `EXPUNGE` (sets `\Deleted`) | `uid` int, `folder` string |
| `mark_email_read` | yes | IMAP `STORE` `\Seen` flag | `uid` int, `folder` string, `read` bool (default true) |

Read operations accept `limit` in `1..20`; out-of-range values fall back to
the default of 5. `mark_as_read=true` via `read_inbox` sets the server-side
`\Seen` flag; clear it with `mark_email_read(read=false)`.

`describeAction()` renders each call for the approval UI through
`EmailActionDescriber`, so the human-readable summary in the Spora admin
shows the specific recipient, folder, or UID being acted on.

## Provider setup

SMTP and IMAP are protocols, not a SaaS — you point the plugin at any host.
A few common operators:

- **Gmail (Google Workspace + personal)** — IMAP requires an
  [App password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) since May
  2022; the account password will not work even with IMAP enabled. Hosts:
  `imap.gmail.com:993` (SSL), `smtp.gmail.com:587` (TLS).
- **Outlook / Microsoft 365** — IMAP/SMTP AUTH requires an
  [app password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/using-app-passwords-with-apps-that-dont-support-two-factor-verification-5896ed9b-4263-e681-128a-a6f2979a7944)
  when MFA is enforced, or OAuth2 for full-flow auth. Hosts:
  `outlook.office365.com:993` (SSL), `smtp.office365.com:587` (TLS).
- **Fastmail** — IMAP/SMTP work with the account password (or an
  [app password](https://www.fastmail.com/help/clients/creating-an-app-password.html)
  if MFA is on). Hosts: `imap.fastmail.com:993`, `smtp.fastmail.com:587`.
- **iCloud** — Requires an [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397)
  (Apple ID MFA does not allow raw account passwords). Hosts:
  `imap.mail.me.com:993`, `smtp.mail.me.com:587`.
- **Self-hosted Postfix + Dovecot** — Plain STARTTLS on `143`/`587`, or
  implicit TLS on `993`/`465`. Match `imap_encryption` and
  `smtp_encryption` to whatever the MTA exposes.

Always use an **app password / app-specific password** when the provider
supports MFA — raw account passwords are rejected by every major provider
once MFA is enrolled, and storing a raw password in Spora config defeats the
encryption-at-rest guarantees in `ToolConfigService`. Never commit config
files containing real passwords; rotate any credential that does end up in
git history.
